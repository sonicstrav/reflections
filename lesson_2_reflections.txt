What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is added. A commit is not made initially - it needs to be done manually. Files are not tracked - the files to be tracked are added from the  working directory to the staging area using git add. On commit the files from 
the staging area are moved into the repository.
