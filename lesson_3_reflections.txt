GitHub - remote repository called a 'remote'
No working directory or staging area on GitHub

GitHub does not allow cloning from local to remote
Create a new repository on GitHub then push to the remote

We can push and pull data from the remote

-----------------------------------------------------------
Creating a new repository on GitHub

1) Click the + in the top bar > New Repository
2) Name the repository
3) If commits in the repository already no need to tick initialize repository
4) In git bash type
		git remote add (name) (url)  if only one remote it is called origin
5) To push the local master branch to the remote type
		git push origin master 
		
-----------------------------------------------------------
Create a new file in GitHub

1) Click the + next to the repository name

----------------------------------------------------------
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Required for collaboration on a project or to access from another computer
----------------------------------------------------------

After editing on GitHub the local and remote repositories are not in sync. The 
remote master will need to be pulled back to the local repository. This will 
bring the new commits to local and update the local master. To get it run
git pull
----------------------------------------------------------

Forking a repository

Clone another person's repository (A) to the local repository (B) - this will
automatically set the other person's repository (A) as a remote. Then create a new
repository (C) on GitHub and push the local repository (B) to the new repository
(C). Other people (D) can clone this repository (C) but there is no recognition
of the author of the content from the original repository (A).

Forking a repository allows you to make a copy of someone's repository directly
on the GitHub servers which is much less complicated. This just requires a 
single click. This can be pulled down to the local machine to create a new 
version.

Use git clone (url) to clone the repository to the the local repository

To allow another user to collaborate on the project they will need permission
to push to the remote. 

On the GitHub page:
Settings > Collaborators > Add GitHub username of the user

Updating local copies of remote branches

git fetch origin   
will update all the local copies of every branch of the origin remote

Inspect the local copies by running 
git log origin/master          
or git diff origin/master master
